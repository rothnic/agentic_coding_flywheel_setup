  vcpu: {
    term: "vCPU",
    short: "Virtual CPU, a share of a physical processor's computing power",
    long: "A vCPU (virtual CPU) is a portion of a physical processor that's assigned to your VPS. When a VPS has '4 vCPUs,' you're getting the equivalent of 4 processor cores. These aren't dedicated physical chips; the cloud provider divides a powerful physical server into multiple virtual machines. More vCPUs mean your server can do more things simultaneously: running multiple AI agents, compiling code, and serving requests all at once.",
    analogy: "Think of a pizza cut into 8 slices. If you order '2 vCPUs,' you get 2 slices of the pizza (the physical processor). You're sharing the pizza with others, but your slices are guaranteed to be there when you're hungry. The more slices you have, the more computing tasks you can handle at once.",
    why: "For AI coding agents, vCPU count matters because running multiple agents simultaneously requires parallel processing power. A 4-vCPU server can comfortably run 2-3 AI agents in parallel, while an 8-vCPU server handles 4-6 agents. When the wizard recommends specs, vCPUs determine how much parallel work your server can handle.",

  ram: {
    term: "RAM",
    short: "Random Access Memory, the fast temporary storage your computer uses while working",
    long: "RAM (Random Access Memory) is your computer's short-term memory. Unlike your hard drive which stores files permanently, RAM holds data that programs are actively using right now. When you open an application, it loads into RAM for fast access. More RAM means you can run more programs simultaneously without slowdowns. When you close a program, its RAM is freed up; when you shut down, RAM is erased (it's 'volatile' memory).",
    analogy: "RAM is like your desk space while working. A bigger desk (more RAM) lets you spread out more documents and work on multiple things without constantly putting papers away and getting new ones. Your filing cabinet (hard drive/SSD) stores everything long-term, but your desk is where active work happens. If your desk is too small, you spend all your time shuffling papers instead of working.",
    why: "AI coding agents are memory-hungry. Each agent session can use 2-4 GB of RAM, and running multiple agents multiplies that. The code they analyze, the context they maintain, and the tools they use all live in RAM. With 16 GB RAM, you can comfortably run 2-3 agents; with 32 GB or more, you can run a full agent swarm. The '16 GB minimum' recommendation ensures you won't hit frustrating slowdowns.",

  nvme: {
    term: "NVMe SSD",
    short: "Ultra-fast solid-state storage that's 10x faster than traditional hard drives",
    long: "NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSDs are the fastest type of storage available. Unlike traditional hard drives with spinning disks, SSDs have no moving parts. NVMe goes further by connecting directly to your computer's high-speed lanes, eliminating bottlenecks. Read/write speeds of 3,000-7,000 MB/second are common, compared to 100-200 MB/second for traditional drives. This makes everything faster: booting, loading programs, searching files, and especially package installations.",
    analogy: "Imagine the difference between sending a letter through the mail (hard drive) versus texting (SSD), versus a direct brain-to-brain link (NVMe). NVMe storage talks to your processor with almost no delay, making everything feel instant.",
    why: "AI coding involves constant file operations: reading code, writing changes, searching text, installing packages. NVMe storage makes all of this nearly instant. When ripgrep searches 10,000 files, NVMe means results appear in milliseconds. When bun installs packages, they extract instantly. Fast storage is one of those upgrades where you don't realize how much it matters until you experience it.",

Unlike your laptop, it's always on, always connected, and you have full administrator access. Companies like DigitalOcean, Hetzner, and Linode rent these out starting around $5-20/month.",
    analogy: "Think of it like renting an apartment instead of buying a house. You get your own private space (the server) inside a big building (the data center). Someone else handles the electricity, internet, and physical maintenance while you just use it.",
    why: "We use a VPS because AI coding agents work best with lots of CPU power, memory, and a stable internet connection. Your laptop could work, but a VPS gives you a dedicated workspace that stays running even when your laptop is closed.",

These servers are called 'cloud' because they seem to exist 'somewhere out there' rather than on your desk. Major providers include AWS (Amazon), Google Cloud, Azure (Microsoft), DigitalOcean, and Hetzner.",
    analogy: "Imagine renting a really powerful computer that lives in a building with perfect electricity, super-fast internet, and 24/7 security guards. You can access it from anywhere in the world using just your laptop and an internet connection.",

When you 'SSH into your VPS,' you're opening an encrypted connection that lets you type commands as if you were sitting at that computer. Everything you type is encrypted, so nobody can spy on what you're doing, not even your internet provider.",
    analogy: "Imagine a secret, soundproof phone line between you and your VPS. When you pick up the phone (SSH), you can talk directly to your remote computer. Nobody can eavesdrop, and you can give it commands as if you were right there.",
    why: "SSH is the secure way to access remote servers. It's been the industry standard for over 25 years because it's simple, reliable, and incredibly secure. Every system administrator and developer uses it daily.",

  terminal: {
    term: "Terminal",
    short: "A text-based interface to control your computer by typing commands",
    long: "The terminal (also called command line, console, or shell) is a way to control your computer by typing text commands instead of clicking icons. It might look intimidating at first with just a blinking cursor waiting for input, but it's actually incredibly powerful. Most professional developers spend significant time in the terminal because it's faster and more precise than clicking through menus.",
    analogy: "Instead of pointing and clicking, you're texting your computer. You type what you want ('show me all my files'), press Enter, and it does it. It's like having a conversation with your computer in a very specific language.",
    why: "AI coding agents work primarily through the terminal because it's the most direct way to tell a computer what to do. Commands are precise, repeatable, and can be automated, which is exactly what AI agents need.",

    short: "A command to download files and web pages from the internet",
    long: "curl is a command-line tool that fetches content from URLs, like a text-based web browser. When you see 'curl ... | bash', it means: download a script from the internet and immediately run it. It's a common pattern for one-line installers. For example, 'curl https://example.com/install.sh | bash' downloads the install script and runs it in one step.",
    analogy: "It's like right-clicking a link and choosing 'Save As...' but without the clicking. You just tell it the URL and it fetches the content for you.",

    term: "bash",
    short: "The default command interpreter on most Linux systems",
    long: "Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the program that interprets what you type in the terminal and tells the computer what to do. When you type 'ls' to list files, bash is what understands that command and executes it. It's the default shell on most Linux systems and macOS (though Mac now defaults to zsh). Beyond running commands, bash also lets you write scripts, which are files full of commands that run automatically.",
    analogy: "Bash is like a translator between you and your computer. You speak in human-readable commands, and bash converts them into actions the computer understands.",

    long: "Zsh (Z Shell) is a shell like bash, but with many quality-of-life improvements: better tab completion (it can complete file names, git branches, command options), spelling correction, shared command history across terminals, and thousands of plugins. Most commands that work in bash also work in zsh, so you're not learning a new language, just getting a nicer experience.",
    analogy: "If bash is a reliable Honda Civic, zsh is a Tesla. Same basic purpose (driving/running commands), but with lots of smart features that make the experience much more pleasant.",

Instead of manually configuring everything, you just enable the plugins you want. For example, the git plugin adds shortcuts like 'gst' for 'git status' and 'gco' for 'git checkout'.",

It can show: current directory, git branch and status, Python/Node version, command execution time, background jobs, and much more, all color-coded and with icons. Despite showing all this info, it's designed to be extremely fast (instant prompt).",
    analogy: "It's like a dashboard for your terminal. Instead of a plain blinking cursor, you get a heads-up display showing everything relevant about your current state.",

  cli: {
    term: "CLI",

    long: "A CLI (Command Line Interface) is any program you interact with by typing commands rather than clicking buttons. Examples: 'git' (version control), 'npm' (package management), 'docker' (containers). CLI tools are popular with developers because they're scriptable (you can automate them), precise (exact commands, exact results), and fast (no waiting for graphics to load).",
    analogy: "If a GUI (graphical interface) is like driving with a steering wheel and pedals, a CLI is like typing exact coordinates to a self-driving car. More precise, more automatable, but requires learning the commands.",

Instead of memorizing Git commands, you see everything and use keyboard shortcuts. Press 's' to stage a file, 'c' to commit, 'space' to toggle. It makes Git visual and fast without leaving the terminal.",
