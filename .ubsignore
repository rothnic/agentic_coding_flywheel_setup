# UBS ignore globs (codebase scan hygiene)
#
# Purpose: keep UBS focused on source, not build artifacts or vendored deps.
# Note: patterns are evaluated relative to the project root.

# Dependencies / vendored
node_modules/
apps/web/node_modules/
packages/**/node_modules/

# Next.js build output
apps/web/.next/

# Research scripts (Playwright $$eval triggers UBS eval heuristics)
apps/web/research_*.mjs

# Generator embeds shell scripts in template strings (UBS JS heuristics produce false positives)
packages/manifest/src/generate.ts

# Playwright artifacts
apps/web/playwright-report/
apps/web/test-results/

# Vercel metadata
apps/web/.vercel/
packages/onboard/.vercel/
